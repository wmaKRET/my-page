Back in the days I used to study Computer Science but due to health issues I needed to change my plans. Becoming frontend developer won't be easy but I know that hard and consistent work will get me there one day."

        text: "Physical activity is a big part of my life. I've been running around football since I can remember. Few years ago I used to play football in local teams but sadly I torn my ACL so I ended up doing less dangerous sports. Right now I focus mainly on staying healthy - I love to run and train in the gym. Competition is close to my hearth so I often watch football games, MMA events or even e-sports tournaments."

        text: "I took part in three biggest hitchhiking races in Europe. Despite not traveling like that lately I still love this activity. Hitchiking is a really great way of travelling for people whom likes adventures. You need to constantly be on your toes and 'puzzle solve' how to reach checkpoints and destination. On the road I've met many different people as I was racing to cities of Tarquinia, Fa≈æana and Calabria. In those three years I've traveled with strangers for over 5 000 km throught Europe."
